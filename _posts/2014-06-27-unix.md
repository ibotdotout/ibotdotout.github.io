$ cmd >> <file> # print output to file (append)  
$ cmd 2> <file> # print error to file  
$ cmd &> <file> # print output & error to file  
$ cmd < <file> # use file as  input  
$ cmd << <file> # use file as input  
```

### Jobs

$ jobs # list active jobs  
$ fg # put the current in the foreground  
Ctrl-z # Suspend a foreground job
```

### Crontab Time schedule

```sh
$ crontab -e #edit crontab profile
# */5 * * * * cmd
# run cmd every five minutes
$ grep CRON /var/log/syslog #see crontablog (debian)
```


### Shell Script

```sh
#!/bin/sh

VAR = "hello"
if [ "$VAR" = "hello" ]; then  # use = to equal string not ==
  echo $VAR
else
  echo "fasle"
fi

### Zsh History expansion 
should also work with bash.

```sh
$ man zshexpn # manual for look in-depth  
$ history # tell history command that keep in ~/.bash_history  
$ history -c # clear history  
! # previous that can combine with command and argument  
$ !! # call previous command  
$ !<str> # call last command that start with str  
$ !?<str>[?] # call last command containing str  
$ !<hist_number> # call command in nth of history files  
 ^ # first argument  
 $ # last argument  
 <n> # nth argument  
 * # all argument  
$ <space><cmd> # call command without keep history
```

### Zsh Basic Editing

```sh
$ bindkey -v # vi mode  
$ bindkey -e # emac mode  
Ctrl + a # moves the cursor to begin of line

Ctrl + q, u # delete while line  
Ctrl + w # delete word backwords  
Ctrl + d # delete char (moves forward)
