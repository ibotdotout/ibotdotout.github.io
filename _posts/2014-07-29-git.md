## fatal: CRLF would be replaced by LF in ...

Because there is differenced end of line in dos and unix.

```sh
# open file that error in vim
:set noendofline binary
:wq
```

## Global Ignore

```sh
# set where is global gitignore file
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
# write some ignore file in global gitignore
$ echo "tags" >> ~/.gitignore_global
```
