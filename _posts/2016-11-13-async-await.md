Async/Await is the part of ES7 that currently draft version new standard of
javascript. It is pattern for solving [Callback Hell](http://callbackhell.com)
problem that nowaday is solve by [ES6 Promises](http://www.datchley.name/es6-promises/).
Async/Await is wrapper of Promises pattern that make you can program in
synchronous style without blocking the thread. To use ES7 for your project
today, you need to use [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to compile your ES7 to ES5
that can run in client side with browser and server side with nodeJS
