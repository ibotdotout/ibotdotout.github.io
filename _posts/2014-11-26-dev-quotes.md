* [The Best Programming Advice I Ever Got" with Rob Pike](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1941206)

    ```
    Ken taught me that thinking before debugging is extremely important. If you
    dive into the bug, you tend to fix the local issue in the code, but if you
    think about the bug first, how the bug came to be, you often find and correct a
    higher-level problem in the code that will improve the design and prevent
    further bugs.
    ```

* If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else - [Yogi Berra](https://medium.com/@geoffbourne/the-marriage-of-lean-scrum-and-extreme-programming-xp-98a7d5df06b1)

* [How to Become a Great Front-End Engineer - PHILIP WALTON](https://philipwalton.com/articles/how-to-become-a-great-front-end-engineer)

   ```
   I realize that what separates the good people from the really good people
   isn’t what they know; it’s how they think. Obviously knowledge is
   important—critical in some cases—but in a field that changes so quickly,
   how you go about acquiring that knowledge is always going to be more
   important (at least in the long term) than what you know at any given time.
   And perhaps most important of all: how you use that knowledge to solve
   everyday problems.
   ```

* If you’re working on a big, popular application like Word or Facebook for
  Android, you can still have plenty of impact that way just due to heft of
  that application’s user base, but it’s still an application. - [Why I Like Systems Programming, DANIEL COLASCIONE](https://www.facebook.com/notes/daniel-colascione/why-i-like-systems-programming/10155148436801102)

  Batalion](https://medium.com/lightspeed-venture-partners/most-tech-interviews-suck-the-only-4-questions-that-matter-1a71181ef4d4)

    ```
    Remember that I’m hiring you to build products not write software.
    It’s a very important distinction.  You’ll make hundreds of micro
    decisions every day about what and how to build products and
    I want to know that you understand our business and will put that
    as your first priority.

* When a programmer talks about how they “would love coding more, if it weren’t for all the users”, I assume I am talking to a junior developer. - [The Role of a Senior Developer](http://mattbriggs.net/blog/2015/06/01/the-role-of-a-senior-developer/)

* if you don’t understand the logic behind the code, you won’t be able to write it in any language. - [Programming will never be “easy”](https://mdmstudios.wordpress.com/2010/08/28/programming-will-never-be-easy/)

* often times programmers assume they are getting better, when in reality, the technology/methodology around them is getting better, and their actual skill level is still about the same. - [The Violin Effect](https://mdmstudios.wordpress.com/2010/08/29/the-violin-effect/)

* [Learning Programming Languages Faster](https://mdmstudios.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/learning-programming-languages-faster/)

   ```
   they’re missing the point clearly.
   It’s not the learning languages that is important, its the learning how to program.
   Its learning how to problem solve.

    When you watch a new programmer learn to program,
    they’ll think in terms of “What feature would I use to solve this problem”,
    if you watch someone who is more experienced they tend to think in terms of “How would I solve this problem”
    and then “How would I implement that in this language” or “What tool will I use to implement my solution?”.

    The secret to becoming a better programmer isn’t in learning the most languages,
    its learning to program the best.
   ```

* Sometimes it’s important to go back to the basics and remember what we love about programming; sometimes it’s important to remember that programming is an art form; a form of expression as much as a science. - [Programming as an Art](https://mdmstudios.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/programming-as-an-art/)

* Don’t ever go silent. Try the hardest to keep your words. This is a timeless quality that everyone will need from you.
- [Piyorot](https://medium.com/inspiring-home/promise-e52e19d6d62e)

* As a developer, there is too much out there to master everything. Don’t even try. Learn how you work best as a developer, build a toolset that fits you, and don’t try to have all the answers. Focus on learning how to find the answers quickly. -  [This Picture Will Change the Way You Learn to Code - Saul Costa](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/this-picture-will-change-the-way-you-learn-to-code-557ac1e109bd)

    John Gall said, “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.
    A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work.
    ou have to start over with a working simple system.”
    ```

*  “TDD is not dead or alive. TDD is subject to tradeoffs, including risk of API changes, skill of practitioner and existing design” — [Kent Beck](https://blog.daftcode.pl/hype-driven-development-3469fc2e9b22)

* “Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.” - [Robert C.

* [Things You Should Never Do, Part I - JOEL ON SOFTWARE](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)

    ```
    There’s a subtle reason that programmers always want to throw away the code and start over.
    The reason is that they think the old code is a mess. And here is the interesting observation:
    they are probably wrong.
    The reason that they think the old code is a mess is because of a cardinal, fundamental law of programming:

    It’s harder to read code than to write it.
    ```

    ```
    But I’m going to take up Sheryl Sandberg’s advice here:

    There is no perfect fit when you’re looking for the next big thing to do.
    You have to take opportunities and make an opportunity fit for you,
    rather than the other way around. The ability to learn is the most
    important quality a leader can have.
